This repository contains an organized collection of queries (CQL) designed to facilitate Threat Hunting tasks, incident investigation, and proactive detection of anomalous or malicious activities in environments monitored with CrowdStrike Falcon.

The goal is to maintain a structured and reusable set of queries that allow you to:
* Identify suspicious behaviors.
* Detect known attack techniques and compromise patterns.
* Support incident response and forensic analysis processes.
* Facilitate proactive hunting for emerging threats.

ðŸ’¡ Recommended Use:
* Detection enhancement in production environments.
* Support for analysis activities during incidents.
* Hypothesis generation for periodic hunting exercises.

### NOTE: This repository includes queries from other public repositories I have used as a reference, as well as custom queries developed for hunting purposes.
